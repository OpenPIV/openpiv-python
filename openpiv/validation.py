    This validation method tests for the spatial consistency of the data

    one of the two velocity components is out of a specified global range.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    u : 2d np.ndarray
        a two dimensional array containing the u velocity component.

        a two dimensional array containing the v velocity component.
        
    u_thresholds: two elements tuple
        u_thresholds = (u_min, u_max). If ``u<u_min`` or ``u>u_max``
        the vector is treated as an outlier.
        
    v_thresholds: two elements tuple
        ``v_thresholds = (v_min, v_max)``. If ``v<v_min`` or ``v>v_max``

    -------

    v : 2d np.ndarray
        a two dimensional array containing the v velocity component.
        
    sig2noise : 2d np.ndarray
        a two dimensional array containing the value  of the signal to
