    The algorithm is the following:
    
    1) For each element in the arrays of the ``u`` and ``v`` components, replace it by a weighted average
       of the neighbouring elements which are not nan. The weights depends
       of the method type. If ``method=localmean`` weight are equal to 1/( (2*kernel_size+1)**2 -1 )
       
    2) Several iterations are needed if there are adjacent nan elements.

       regions iteratively, until the variation is below a certain threshold.

    u : 2d np.ndarray
