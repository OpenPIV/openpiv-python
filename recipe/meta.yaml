  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows,
  # use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key. By default,
  # the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge
  # and for all major OSs. Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example)
  # to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit
  # to Windows.
