Dependencies
============

OpenPIV would not have been possible if other great open source projects did not
exist. We make extensive use of code and tools that other people have created, so 
you should install them before you can use OpenPIV.

The dependencies are:

* `python <http://python.org/>`_
* `scipy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
* `numpy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
* `cython <http://cython.org/>`_
* `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`_

On all the platforms, the binary Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) is recommended.

How to install the dependencies on Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On a Linux platform installing these dependencies should be trick. Often, if not always, 
python is installed by default, while the other dependencies should appear in your package
manager.

/**
Example of installation procedure on Ubuntu
(tested for version 10.04 to 12.10)
	*open a terminal & install modules
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install cython
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
pip install -U scikit-image
	*you will need version 1.6.0 or later of the numpy module. 
	*If pip cannot find the right version, easyinstall should work:
         	sudo easyinstall numpy
	*now download openpiv source code and move to the openpiv directory
	*then install openpiv:
sudo python setup.py install
	*open a new terminal & test openpiv
openpiv
	*if you get an error such as "unknown module lib" try to logout or try to modify the PYTHONPATH variable by adding
	      export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:[path-to-openpiv-directory]  
	to your ~/.bashrc file and then logout or:
	 source ~/.bashrc

How to install the dependencies on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On Windows all these dependencies, as well as several other useful packages, can be installed
using the Python(x,y) distribution, available at http://www.pythonxy.com/

How to install the dependencies on a Mac
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The binary (32 or 64 bit) Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) is recommended.  Visit http://www.enthought.com 


Get OpenPIV source code!
========================

At this moment the only way to get OpenPIV's source code is using git. 
`Git <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29>`_ Git is a distributed revision control system and 
our code is hosted at `GitHub <www.github.com>`_.


Use PyPI and pip
================

    pip install -U openpiv
    

Downloads the code from PyPI and runs the setup for you with installation and Cython (if preinstalled)

Bleeding edge development version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are interested in the source code you are welcome to browse out git repository
stored at https://github.com/gasagna/OpenPIV. If you want to download the source code
on your machine, for testing, you need to set up git on your computer. Please look at 
http://help.github.com/ which provide extensive help for how to set up git.

To follow the development of OpenPIV, clone our repository with the command::

    git clone http://github.com/alexlib/openpiv-python.git

and update from time to  time. You can also download a tarball containing everything.

Then add the path where the OpenPIV source are to the PYTHONPATH environment variable, so 
that OpenPIV module can be imported and used in your programs. Remeber to build the extension
with :: 

    python setup.py build
